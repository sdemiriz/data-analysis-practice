Q1 - They were about equal in terms of the ease of working with them
    as they share most syntax, and both are clear and concise code-wise.
    How the data appeared was easier to read on Pandas dues to the 
    names of rows and columns being displayed clearly rather than being
    implied as in the Numpy implementation. The latter might be a side
    effect of me using Jupyter Notebook to view the data, however.

Q2 - The Pandas implementation ran at   46.4 ms +- 5.16 ms per loop
     The loop implementation ran at     600 ms +- 2.61 ms per loop

    So the pandas implementation was about 12 times faster than the 
    loop implementation. This is due to Pandas having less overhead 
    in its code and being run through its own optimized C-based array 
    approach rather than Python's own unoptimized pointer array 
    approach.
