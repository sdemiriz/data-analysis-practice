1.
The K-Nearest Neighbors classifier had the best results. This is likely due to a point that is 
surrounded mostly by other points of similar colors is much more likely to be of that color as 
well, rather than being of a different color. The latter only occurs on the boundaries between 
the color spaces.

The model mostly mispredicts when the climates of a given pair of cities are very similar such
 as Vancouver and Seattle or Calgary and Edmonton. Yearly sunny days might give another lead
 for the algorithm to be able to predict more accurately.
