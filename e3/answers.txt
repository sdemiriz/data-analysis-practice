1. LOWESS missed a lot of the smaller temperature spikes while Kalman was more accurate at detecting them, giving more accurate spikes in those cases. This is 
of course said assuming all the temperature spikes were genuine and not false readings. Kalman did not smoothe over and/or ignore lesser variations in 
temperatures like LOWESS did, giving a more detailed look on the readings. Yet it was able to remove sufficient noise to produce a reasonable, non-overfit plot.

2. Speed would benefit us in a scenario where the person is standing, like waiting for a traffic light to switch etc. where we could ignore the cluster of data
that will form from the nearly identical noisy GPS readings produced by the person standing still. Course could be used along with the speed, latitude and
longitude data to more accurately determine the person's movements, allowing for more accurate smoothing.
