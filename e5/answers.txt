1.  Applying the log-transformation to the data gave the best result that satisfied our assumptions.

2.  Running the T-test on non-transformed data:
    The number of comments on weekdays and weekends is significantly different.

3.  I believe the weekly data is the best, in our case, to get an answer to the original question. 
    Perhaps comparing the weekdays to the weekend that follows them and drawing conclusions from
    the results of this comparison might be a more realistic way to approach the question at hand.
    The events that had occured during weekdays are likely to influence the quantity of comments 
    in the following days and the weekend.

4.  More comments are posted in /r/canada on average weekdays than average weekends.
