1. The residuals are not close enough to being normal. We cannot reasonably conclude that the 
ratings are increasing.

2. The new prediction seems to be doing a better job of not smoothing as much as the previous 
one did. Now, the Kalman filter seems to be able to capture the sudden spikes in CPU 
temperature present in the data much better than the previous one did, providing better results.
