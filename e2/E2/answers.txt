1. The type of the values is float64. The values are from 
10.71 to 14.25, and are generally increasing as the date
increases.

2. This produces a fit on the graph due to datetime and
timestamps having float representations under the hood.
The plot represents both axes as floats when representing
the data, and due to both having the same amount of values
it has no problem aligning the two axes of values.
