1. Looking at the produced plot, average max temperature does not seem to have much, if any correlation
with population density. However, a clear observation can be made about a large majority of cities,
regardless of their population density, residing in the average temperature range of 15-30 degrees
celsius. A model based on this data will likely place any new predictions in this range of temperatures.
If the population density is low enough for a prediction, as in comparable to those cities in the 5-10 
degrees celsius average temperature range, they might be placed in that range instead. However the raw
amount of data points in the 15-30 degree range will likely have a larger effect on the model and will
likely influence predictions drastically.

2. An uncompressed json file, in some cases, might take up our entire available memory, if not more. If
we decompress the json file as a part of our workflow, read as much of it into memory and feed it into 
pandas/numpy we might require additional accesses to get the rest of the json file from disk. Since disk
accesses are slow compared to memory accesses, it is preferable to just load the compressed json file 
into memory, then access it by decompressing as much of it as needed without accessing the disk several 
times. This should improve our runtime.
